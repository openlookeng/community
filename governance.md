# openLooKeng Governance

[English](./governance.md) | [简体中文](./governance_cn.md)


## Introduction

The openLooKeng project is managed by PMC (Project Management Committee). Besides PMC, User Group provides a way for downstream users to communicate and provide general questions and discussion on using openLooKeng.

They shared some ways to operate.

### Communication

Communication is done via mailing lists. And virtual meeting is held for members that are geographically distributed.

They additionally use more synchronous messaging (Slack). In general, asynchronous communication is much more important because it allows archives to be created and it's more tolerant on the volunteer nature of the various communities.

### Decision Making

Projects are normally auto governing and driven by the people who volunteer for the job. This is sometimes referred to as "do-ocracy" -- power of those who do. This functions well for most cases.

When coordination is required, decisions are taken with a lazy consensus approach: **a few positive votes with no negative vote** is enough to get going.

Voting is done with numbers:

- +1 -- a positive vote

- 0 -- abstain, have no opinion

- -1 -- a negative vote

The rules require that a negative vote includes an alternative proposal or a detailed explanation of the reasons for the negative vote.

The community then tries to gather consensus on an alternative proposal that resolves the issue. In the great majority of cases, the concerns leading to the negative vote can be addressed.

This process is called "consensus gathering" and we consider it a very important indication of a healthy community.

## Project Management Committee

The project management committee (PMC) is a committee with responsibility and governance for the openLooKeng project. The PMC is the vehicle through which decision making power and responsibility for oversight devolves to developers.

While committers on a project have the ability to update the code, only the PMC as a body has the authority to vote on formal releases of the project's software. The PMC is also responsible for voting in new committers and PMC members to the project, as well as following other policies as outlined in this document.

The PMC make decisions with a lazy consensus approach: **a few positive votes with no negative vote** is enough to get going.

Th PMC has the following responsibilities:

- Report project status biweekly or when requested to the community

- Collaborate remotely, having a face-to-face every 6 monthes. Have regularly online meeting in between.

- Guide and decide project technology roadmap, interface definition, architecture design, build release, etc. Establishing the rule of community gradually.

- Coordinate cross-projects cooperation and make decisions on cross-project technical issues in the community

- Formulate project incubation and development processes to support the healthy development of community technology ecology

- Adjust existing projects in the community according to the community development blueprint, delete or archive projects that do not meet the project goal

Biweekly meeting: 11:00-12:00 am, Friday, UTC+8. It happens on Slack.

### Committers

The responsibility of Committers is to review and approve the commits made by developers.

It is the responsibility of each the PMC to review productive contributors to the project and consider nominating those contributors as committers, and then voting them in as committers (and possibly PMC members as well). PMCs should be guiding their new committers.

### Quality Assurance

The QA team is engaged in the following activities:

- Open current test capability to developers who can use and contribute

- Draft, release and maintain release criteria

- Develop and maintain test tools which promote code development and execution efficiency

- Running test open days which focuse on testing a specific feature or component

Mail List: dev@openlookeng.io

Slack: 

Biweekly meeting: 03:00-04:00 am, Tuesday, UTC. It happens on Slack.

## User Group

The User Group helps end users on how to use openLooKeng, and collects improvemeng suggestions to the PMC.

The User Group provides mail list and Slack for downstream users to communicate and provide general questions and discussion on using openLooKeng.

## Secretariat

The secretariat is responsible for the operation of the openEuler community. The main responsibilities of the openEuler community secretariat are as follows:
